Author:       Bruno FREDERIC
Type:         comm/tcp
Version:      1.7

Distribution: Aminet
Requires:     util/libs/ReqToolsUsr.lha
Replaces:     comm/tcp/DCTelnet_16.lha

DCTelnet is a Telnet client for Commodore Amiga computers. It is easy to
use, lightweight, and reliable.

DCTelnet is ideal for accessing Telnet-enabled BBS systems on classic Amiga
hardware, and supports file transfers via ZModem.

Note: This release provides recompiled versions of DCTelnet including a
68000-compatible binary for classic Amiga systems (A500, A600, A2000), as
well as an optimized 68020 build.

DCTelnet was originally written by Zed. As of January 2026, the DCTelnet
1.5/1.6 releases available on Aminet target 68020+ CPUs only.

This new release also offers simplified installation and improved
documentation.

- Additional terminal emulations via XEM libraries
- User-definable screen modes, fonts & colour palettes
- Iconify support
- multiple simultaneous Telnet connections
- No MUI, ClassAct or ReAction required

---

## Requirements

- Kickstart / Workbench v2.00 (V36) or higher
- A TCP/IP stack: AmiTCP, Miami, UAE bsdsocket.library or compatible
- ReqTools library

---

## Installation

1. Install the ReqTools library, available on Aminet:
   https://aminet.net/package/util/libs/ReqToolsUsr

2. Download the DCTelnet package either from Aminet:
   https://aminet.net/package/comm/tcp/DCTelnet
   or from https://github.com/bruno-frederic/dctelnet/releases

3. The DCTelnet archive includes an Installer script.
   When available, using the *Installer* tool is the recommended
   installation method.

---

### Manual installation

On older AmigaOS versions where the *Installer* tool is not present (for
example, pre-3.1.4 systems), DCTelnet can be installed manually. In this
case, copy the required files to their respective system directories:

- DCTelnet/Devs/ibmcon.device -> DEVS:
- Libraries from DCTelnet/Libs -> LIBS:
- Fonts from DCTelnet/Fonts -> FONTS:

The archive also includes an optional GlowIcons icon set, which can be used
as a modern replacement for the original icons if desired.

## How to use

Please refer to the included DCTelnet.guide documentation for detailed
usage instructions. The guide is in AmigaGuide format and can be opened
with MultiView on AmigaOS.

## Known Bugs


### Character display issues and font selection

If, after connecting to a BBS, some characters appear incorrect or garbled,
this is usually related to the selected terminal font. Make sure the font
matches the character set expected by the remote system.

Many PC-based BBSes require an ANSI-compatible font to properly display
line art and ANSI graphics. In such cases, select the bundled HyperANSI
font.

On Amiga-based BBSes, graphics are often designed for the classic Topaz
font. This is the case, for example, on Retro 32 BBS.

Important:
After switching the terminal font, quit DCTelnet and restart it before
reconnecting. This avoids the display issue described below and ensures
correct rendering.


### Connection stuck after changing settings (fonts, XEM, screen mode)

After changing certain display-related settings (such as the terminal font,
enabling the XEM library, or switching the screen mode) a subsequent Telnet
connection may appear to succeed, but no output is displayed. The status
remains *Connected*, while the terminal window no longer shows any data.

This issue has been observed both with the original DCTelnet 1.6 built in
2006-2008 and with recent recompilations.

Workaround:
After modifying any of these settings, quit DCTelnet and restart it before
reconnecting. Otherwise, the session may remain stuck in a connected state
with no visible output.


### Address Book may not be saved correctly

Changes made in the Address Book may not be saved correctly if fields are
validated using the mouse.

Workaround:
When editing Address Book entries:

- Press Enter after typing text in each field, especially the password
field
- Or move to the next field using Tab, then press Enter before leaving the
entry

### On AmigaOS / Kickstart 2.00 & 2.02

- The included xprzmodem.library fails to load on these OS versions.

- ReqTools 2.9a, available on Aminet (util/libs/ReqToolsUsr), also fails to
load.

  An older version of ReqTools is required:
  - ReqTools v2.2, available here:
 https://www.nic.funet.fi/pub/amiga/system/libraries/ReqTools-2.2-user.lha
  - Use the library found in the libs13/ directory (version 38.390).
  - Copy reqtools.library to the LIBS: directory.

For troubleshooting, it is recommended to launch DCTelnet from the Shell in
order to see library initialization error messages.

	External Protocol (XPR) Specification
	=====================================

		    Version 2.001

	Version 2.001 of the XPR spec is fully backwards compatible with
the previous version, with a few minor exceptions, some due to actual
documentation mistakes and others due to the fact that some definitions
were not explicit enough.
	This version also specifies some extensions to the spec, see the
file xprotocol.doc.
	It should be pointed out that the xprascii library is provided as
an example mainly to keep the zoo archive small. Meanwhile, a nicer and
more extensive example can be found in Rick Huebner's xprzmodem
implementation, available on BIX in Amiga/listings. Also, the file
xprfuncs.c is no longer the same as the one used in VLT, though
vltface.asm is current.

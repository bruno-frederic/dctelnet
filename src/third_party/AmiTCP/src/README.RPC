AmiTCP/IP Sun SRC 4.0 30/9/1994

This distribution contains Sun Microsystem's implementation of the RPC
and XDR protocols compiled to AmigaOS using AmiTCP, and is compatible
with 4.2BSD and 4.3BSD.  Also included is complete documentation,
utilities, RPC service specification files, and demonstration services
in the format used by the RPC protocol compiler (rpcgen).  See WHAT'S
NEW below for details.

As a new Amiga specific feature, this version contains the "USE_DOSIO"
version of the rpc library. This version can be recognized from the
'd' in the library name (e.g. rpcdr.lib). USE_DOSIO -version uses the
stdio facilities of the V37 (and above) dos.library instead of those
of the SAS/C link library. When used together with USE_DOSIO -version
of the netlib (netd.lib) and when the application is compiled with
USE_DOSIO defined, the executable size will typically be about 5k
smaller wrt. without USE_DOSIO.

NOTE ABOUT SECURE RPC:

This release does not contain the Secure RPC.

ROADMAP

Note: some of the files/directories descibed below are distributed in
AmiTCP/IP source distribution only.

The directory hierarchy is as follows (relative to this directory):

    ../bin/                Utilities (rpcinfo, portmap, cpp and rpcgen).
                           portmap must be started before any other RPC network
                           services are used.

    ../db/rpc              rpc service to program number mapping data base.

    devtools/cpp           Source for the C PreProcessor for the rpcgen
    devtools/rpcgen        Source for the RPC Language compiler (for .x files)

    examples/rpc/          Various demonstration services
    examples/rpc/dir           Remote directory lister
    examples/rpc/msg           Remote console message delivery service
    examples/rpc/sort          Remote sort service

    ../help/RPC.guide      Complete RPC, XDR and NFS documentation in 
                           AmigaGuide format.

    ../netinclude/rpc/     Rpc library header files.
    ../netinclude/rpcsvc/  Service definition files for various services
	                   and the (Unix) server and client code for the
                           Remote Status service.

    rpclib/                Source for the RPC and XDR library.

    util/portmap           Source for the portmap
    util/rpcinfo           Source for the rpcinfo


BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

The library is made and installed by the 'compile.lib' script, among
other libraries. The examples and documentation have their own
makefiles, which must be used to compile them.

The RPC library must be built before any of the examples/utilities. The
devtools are not dependent of the RPC library.

NOTE: PORTMAP MUST BE RUNNING ON YOUR SYSTEM BEFORE YOU START ANY
OTHER RPC SERVICE.

The demonstration services in the examples/rpc directory are not built
by the 'compile.lib'.  To build these, cd to the example directory in
question (eg. examples/rpc/sort) directory and enter "make".  RPCGEN
MUST BE INSTALLED in a path that make can find.  To run the services,
start the portmap program and invoke the service (you probably will
want to put it in the background).  rpcinfo can be used to check that
the service succeeded in getting registered with portmap, and to ping
the service (see rpcinfo's man page).  You can then use the
corresponding client program to exercise the service.

WHAT'S NEW IN THIS RELEASE: RPCSRC 4.0

The previous release was RPCSRC 3.9.  As with all previous releases,
this release is based directly on files from Sun Microsystem's
implementation.

Upgrade from RPCSRC 3.9

1)  RPCSRC 4.0 upgrades RPCSRC 3.9.  Improvements from SunOS 4.0 have
    been integrated into this release.

         copy Catalogs/deutsch/xprzmodem.catalog locale:catalogs/deutsch

         me your translated *.ct-file.

This is basically version 2.50.  I just changed rx_timout from 600 to
30 in send.c to fix uploads so they truly work.

NOTE:  I compiled the 020 version using lattice 5.10b (as well as the
       none '020 version), but since I only have a 68000, I don't know how
       well or if it works.

------

Recompiled the 2.51 020 version as 2.52 after fixing the LmkFile.020 file.
Internal name of the library was being compiled as XprZmodem.Library.020
rather than as XprZmodem.Library.

                           calculation.  Caused 80000005 Guru.

            sprintf()      replaced with Mysprintf() routine.
                           Thanks to Jim Cooper of the SAS institude
                           for  the libinit and linent objects.

            Cyclic Redunduncy Check now uses a 32-bit hard-coded CRC table.

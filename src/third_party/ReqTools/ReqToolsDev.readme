reqtools.library is a standard Amiga shared, runtime library.  The purpose
of ReqTools is to make it a lot quicker and easier to build standard
requesters into your programs.  ReqTools is designed with Commodore's style
guidelines in mind, all requesters have the look-and-feel of AmigaDOS
Release 2.

ReqTools features the following requesters: a query requester, a string
requester, a number requester, a file requester, a font requester, a
palette requester, a volume requester and a screenmode requester.


Release 2.9 (Library version 38.1436):

	Hopefully fixed the problem that rtEZRequestA() could make the
	requester too wide when no gadgets were displayed. As I never
	noticed the problem here, it is a bit hard to know for sure if it
	really is fixed.

	RTPatch 1.7 included.

	Updated Deutsch, Finnish, Norwegian and Russian translations, and
	added Serbian catalog sources (don't quite know if they're update
	though ;).

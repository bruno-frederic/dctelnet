DICE C
~~~~~~
Extract DLibSource.lha for the source of the Dice C libraries.

Type DMake in the shell to create the following libraries:

    reqtoolss.lib     -> stack args
    reqtoolssr.lib    -> registerized args
    reqtoolsl.lib     -> stack args (large data)
    reqtoolslr.lib    -> registerized args (large data)

To generate other flavors (such as a profiled library), simply use the
DICE lbmake utility.

The file reqtools_protos.h should be copied to dinclude:clib (if you have
DICE 3.0).

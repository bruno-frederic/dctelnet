This is a Modula-2 interface (M2Sprint compiler) written by
Michael Griebling (Computer Inspirations) and included with his
kind permission.  Thanks Michael.

Note: The interface is for ReqTools V37 (Release 1.0)!

As soon as I get an updated interface for V38 (Release 2.0) I will
include this in the ReqTools distribution.
